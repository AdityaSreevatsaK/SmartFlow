# Project Plan – MTech Capstone Project

## Title
A Survey of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Optimising Operations in Bike Sharing Services

---

## 📚 Phase 1: Literature Survey (Weeks 1–4)

### Objectives
- Understand existing work in BSS optimisation and RL.
- Identify common techniques (Q-Learning, DQN, PPO, etc.).
- Explore simulation environments used for BSS (SUMO, custom simulators).
- Collect and summarise at least 15–20 relevant papers.

### Deliverables
- Summary table of existing works
- Categorised insights (algorithms used, reward functions, policies)
- Initial draft of literature review section in paper

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2: Foundations (Weeks 5–8)

### Objectives
- Finalise the BSS simulation environment (real-world or synthetic)
- Build understanding of required RL algorithms and libraries
- Preprocess any real or sample data
- Define environment states, actions, rewards clearly

### Deliverables
- Working simulation setup (e.g., grid-based BSS)
- Definition of RL environment for Gym interface
- Reproducible data pipeline if using real data
- Foundation section in paper

---

## 🧠 Phase 3: Basic Model Building (Weeks 9–12)

### Objectives
- Implement basic RL agents (e.g., Q-Learning, DQN)
- Train models in defined environment
- Log and visualise key metrics (rewards, episode lengths)

### Deliverables
- Baseline RL model implementations
- Visual results (reward trends, performance metrics)
- Evaluation of naive vs RL-based strategies

---

## 🔧 Phase 4: Customise & Fine-Tune Model + Demo (Weeks 13–16)

### Objectives
- Customise state/action/reward design to better model BSS
- Try advanced models (PPO, A2C) and fine-tune hyperparameters
- Test strategies for profit maximisation
- Create demo: video or interactive script

### Deliverables
- Tuned RL model(s) with performance summary
- Estimated profit improvement (via simulation)
- Working demo (notebook, script, or Streamlit app)
- Final results section of the paper

---

## 📝 Phase 5: Final Paper Submission (Weeks 17–20)

### Objectives
- Finalise all sections of the paper
- Internal reviews and supervisor suggestions
- Prepare slide deck for presentation
- Submit paper to conference/journal

### Deliverables
- Final paper (PDF + .tex/.docx)
- Presentation deck
- Poster (if required)
