def generate_dispatch_with_hf_agent(optimised_journeys: list) -> str:
    """
    Generates a SmartFlow daily rebalancing report using an agentic AI approach.

    This function performs the following steps:
      1\. Generates a natural language Manager's Briefing using a Hugging Face LLM.
      2\. Builds deterministic, reliable Markdown tables directly from the source data.
      3\. Falls back to a deterministic Markdown report if the LLM step fails.

    Args:
        optimised_journeys (list): List of journey dictionaries, each containing
            'truck_id' and a list of 'legs'. Each leg should have
            'dispatch_time', 'src', 'target', and 'move' keys.

    Returns:
        str: Markdown-formatted report including the Manager's Briefing and dispatch tickets for each truck.
