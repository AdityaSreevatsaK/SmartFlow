This repository contains the work for our MTech Semester 3 Capstone Project. It includes problem definition, data 
exploration, model development, evaluation, and findings. The project is a collaborative effort, demonstrating practical 
applications of machine learning, AI, and data science techniques to solve a real-world problem.

## Project Title
SmartFlow: Reinforcement Learning and Agentic AI for Bike Sharing Optimisation

## Objective
SmartFlow is a novel solution for enhancing the efficiency of bike sharing systems through the integration of deep 
reinforcement learning and agentic AI. The RL model learns optimal actions to balance supply and demand across stations, 
while agentic components handle real-time notifications to ground personnel, such as truck drivers. This dual approach 
ensures both intelligent decision-making and timely execution, offering a scalable and adaptive strategy for modern 
urban transport networks.
