This repository contains the work for our MTech Semester 3 Capstone Project. It includes problem definition, data 
exploration, model development, evaluation, and findings. The project is a collaborative effort, demonstrating practical 
applications of machine learning, AI, and data science techniques to solve a real-world problem.

## Project Title
A Survey of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Optimising Operations in Bike Sharing Services

## Objective
Bike Sharing Services (BSS) offer affordable and convenient last-mile transportation, helping reduce urban traffic 
congestion and pollution. A significant operational challenge in BSS is the repositioning of bikes using trucks to 
balance supply and demand across stations and time intervals. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising 
approach to optimise repositioning strategies, aiming to maximise revenue while minimising operational costs. This 
project presents a comprehensive survey of RL-based methods applied in similar contexts and implements a practical 
solution tailored to a BSS scenario in Bengaluru, estimating the potential increase in profit.
